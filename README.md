# Remote-EV3-Controller

A EV3Server class is run on an EV3 brick, in order to receive commands from EV3ControlGUI1 which includes 
several options for various movements of the brick.

The user is able to either enter commands as they go, or enter in a list of commands in a 'Preset' mode,
which are then automatically executed consecutively.
